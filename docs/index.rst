Welcome to Social Feed Manager!
===============================

Social Feed Manager is a Django application developed by George Washington University Libraries to collect social media data from Twitter. It connects to Twitter's approved API to collect data in bulk and makes it possible for scholars, students, and librarians to identify, select, collect, and preserve Twitter data for research purposes. 

The application code is open source and `available on github`_.

.. _available on github: http://github.com/gwu-libraries/social-feed-manager/ 

**Social Feed Manager was rewritten in 2016; this documentation is for the "old" SFM.** The new SFM documentation is located at `http://sfm.readthedocs.org/ <http://sfm.readthedocs.org/>`_  . The application code for the new SFM is available at the `sfm-ui repo on github`_ and there is a complete `project site <http://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/>`_ as well.
