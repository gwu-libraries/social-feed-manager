Release Notes
=============
Release notes for the official SFM releases. Each release note will tell you what’s new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible changes made in that version.

For those upgrading to a new version of SFM, you will need to check all the backwards-incompatible changes and deprecated features for each ‘final’ release from the one after your current SFM version, up to and including the new version.
