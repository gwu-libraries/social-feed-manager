Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Does Social Feed Manager capture photos and other media embedded in tweets?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of version m5, no.  But this is something we're looking forward
to implementing in the near term.


How far back in time does SFM go when collecting a TwitterUser's tweets?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Twitter API only provides up to the most recent 3200 tweets for an
account.  When a new TwitterUser is added in SFM, the user_timeline script
will request as many tweets as the Twitter API can provide, i.e. up to 3200.


Does Social Feed Manager capture the followers list?
----------------------------------------------------

No. SFM does capture the number of followers at the time the tweet was retrieved. However, the Twitter API does provide a way to retrieve an account's
follower list. 


Do I have to set up supervisord in order to use filterstreams or streamsample?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, filterstreams and streamsample can also be run manually using the
*filterstream* and *streamsample* management commands described in the
management commands page.


The number of retweets in a TwitterItem is inconsistent with the number of retweets shown on the tweet in Twitter.  Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TwitterItems are created as they appear at the time they are captured
from Twitter.  However, tweets on Twitter can change afterwards; they
can be further retweeted, they can be deleted, etc.  In fact, an advantage
of using SFM is that it takes a snapshot of tweets before they change or disappear!

Currently there is no way to "update" a TwitterItem with any changes that
may have occurred to the corresponding tweet.  This is something we might
consider if there is a use case for it.


Does the SFM web interface provide a way to view the files generated by filterstream and streamsample?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not yet. 


When I click on the link to view a raw tweet, it's difficult to read in my browser.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of broswer plugins available (JSONovich, JSONView, and
others) which improve the way that JSON is displayed.


Can I set this up on a Mac?
------------------------------

We haven't been running this on a Mac, but a colleague we met at Code4Lib 2014
has done it.  Check out his blog post here: http://dicarve.blogspot.com/2014/04/an-relatively-easy-way-for-installing.html
