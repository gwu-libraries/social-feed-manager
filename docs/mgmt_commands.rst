Management Commands
====================

Introduction
------------

Many of the key back-end functions of Social Feed Manager (SFM) are invoked
using management commands.  The SFM management commands are standard `Django
management commands <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/django-admin/>`_.  As such, they are invoked like any other Django
management commands:

1. First make sure that your virtualenv is activated.

.. code-block:: none

   $ source ENV/bin/activate

2. From ``<PROJECT_ROOT>/sfm``, execute ``./manage.py`` followed by the
   desired management command, arguments and options.

.. code-block:: none

   $ cd sfm
   $ ./manage.py <command> [args] [options]

SFM management commands may be run:

* manually (i.e. at the command line),
* using cron jobs, and/or
* using supervisord (in the case of filterstream and streamsample)
  as described in the section on :doc:`supervisor and streams
  </supervisor_and_streams>`.

Each SFM management command is described below.


user_timeline
-------------

*user_timeline* calls the Twitter API to retrieve the available tweets for
either all *active* TwitterUsers in SFM, or for a specific *active* 
TwitterUser.  Each tweet is created as a TwitterItem in SFM.

user_timeline connects to the Twitter API as ``TWITTER_DEFAULT_USERNAME``, and
requests the user_timeline by the Twitter account uid (not by account name).
Through the tweepy library, it calls the `Twitter API user_timeline method <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/user_timeline>`_.

For each TwitterUser user_timeline requests only tweets since the newest
tweet that was previously retrieved.  If no tweets were previously retrieved
for that TwitterUser, it requests as many tweets as the Twitter API will
provide (up to the 3200 most recent tweets).

To fetch tweets for all active TwitterUsers in SFM:

.. code-block:: none

   ./manage.py user_timeline

To fetch tweets for a specific twitter user:

.. code-block:: none

   ./manage.py user_timeline --user='twitter username'

The full specification of user_timeline options can be viewed using --help:

.. code-block:: none

   ./manage user_timeline --help

Sample output for user_timeline:

.. code-block:: none
    
    user: pinkfloyd
    since: 1
    saved: 200 item(s)
    since: 1
    max: 326988934884249599
    saved: 200 item(s)
    since: 1
    max: 168992796676591616
    saved: 199 item(s)
    since: 1
    max: 117550550098247679
    saved: 86 item(s)
    stop: < 150 new statuses

update_usernames
----------------

Twitter account owners can, and often do, change the names of their accounts,
although an account's UID never changes.

*update_usernames* looks up the names of the Twitter accounts corresponding to
all active TwitterUsers.  If a Twitter account's name has changed since SFM
last verified the account's name, *update_usernames* will update the name of the
TwitterUser, and will append the former name (and timestamp) to the TwitterUser's former_names value.  former_names is a json field; an example would be:

``{"2014-02-19T21:50:56Z": "OldName", "2014-01-16T13:49:02Z": "EvenOlderName"}``

Note that *update_username* is case sensitive; a change in capitalization *is*
considered a name change.

To update names of all active TwitterUsers:

.. code-block:: none

   ./manage.py update_usernames

To update names of a specific active TwitterUser, by its current name in SFM:

.. code-block:: none

   ./manage.py update_usernames --user='current TwitterUser name in SFM'


populate_uids
--------------

.. deprecated:: m5_001


streamsample
------------

The Twitter API provides a streaming interface which returns a random sample (approximately 0.5%)
of all public tweets.  The SFM *streamsample* management command directs the content of this stream
to files.  The location of these output files is determined by the DATA_DIR variable in the
local_settings.py configuration file.  As *streamsample* is intended to be run as an ongoing,
streaming process, SFM provides a streamsample.conf.template file in
<PROJECT ROOT>/sfm/sfm/supervisor.d that can be copied to streamsample.conf and edited to
include the relevant pathnames, so that it can be run and managed using supervisord.

*streamsample* currently generates 2 GB worth of tweet data per day (roughly 2.2-2.5 million
tweets), so it is important to plan storage capacity accordingly.

To run manually and view streaming output to the console:

.. code-block:: none

     ./manage.py streamsample

To run manually and direct output to files in DATA_DIR:

.. code-block:: none

     ./manage.py streamsample –save

Information on the Twitter API streamsample resource:
https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/sample


filterstream
------------

The Twitter API provides a streaming interface which returns tweets that match one or more filter
predicates.  SFM administrative users can create multiple TwitterFilters, each with its own
predicate parameters.  The SFM *filterstream* management command directs the content of 
one or more active TwitterFilters to files.  The location of these output files is determined by
the DATA_DIR variable in the local_settings.py configuration file. 

*filterstream* is intended to be run as a set of ongoing, streaming processes; SFM automatically
generates the necessary supervisord configuration files.  However, generation of these files
requires the DATA_DIR, SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_USER, and SUPERVISOR_UNIX_SOCKET_FILE settings
variables to be configured in local_settings.py .

Each TwitterFilter may contain the following predicates:

Words - Keywords to track

People - Twitter accounts to track

Location - Geographic bonuding boxes to track

To run manually and view streaming output to the console:

.. code-block:: none

     ./manage.py filterstream

To run manually and direct output to files in DATA_DIR:

.. code-block:: none

     ./manage.py filterstream –save

*filterstream* can also take a parameter corresponding to the number of an individidual
TwitterFilter, e.g.

.. code-block:: none

     ./manage.py filterstream 4 –save

This will run *filterstream* only for the TwitterFilter with an id of 4.
If no TwitterFilter number is given, filterstream will run for all active TwitterFilters.

Information on the Twitter API filter streaming resource:
https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/filter.json


organizedata
------------

*filterstream* and *streamsample* produce sets of data files in the directory determined by DATA_DIR
as configured in local_settings.py .  The data files are written as rotating files; periodically
(as determined by SAVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS in local_settings.py) each file is closed and subsequent
data is written to a new file.  The naming scheme for each data files includes a timestamp.
Over time, this can create many files in the DATA_DIR directory.

The *organizedata* command organizes these files by creating subdirectories named "sample" to
data files from *streamsample*, and "twitterfilter-*n*" for data files from *filterstream*, for
each TwitterFilter.

Within <DATA_DIR>/sample and each <DATA_DIR>/twitterfilter-*n* directory, *organizedata* creates
a tree with a subdirectory for each year; within each year directory, it creates a subdirectory
for each month; within each of these, a subdirectory for each day.

To run *organizedata*:

.. code-block:: none

    ./manage.py organizedata

    
fetch_tweets_by_id
--------------------

Each tweet in Twitter has a unique numerical ID.  The *fetch_tweets_by_id* 
management command takes a file consisting of a list of tweet IDs (one per
line), and fetches the associated tweets as JSON.

Errors are logged to a file given the same name as the input file (specified by `--inputfile`) with
an appended extension of .log (e.g. myinputfile.log)

To fetch tweets and output to the console:

.. code-block:: none

    ./manage.py fetch_tweets_by_id --inputfile='<PATH TO YOUR INPUT FILE>'

To fetch tweets and write to an output file:

.. code-block:: none

   ./manage.py fetch_tweets_by_id --inputfile='<PATH TO YOUR INPUT FILE>' --outputfile='<PATH TO YOUR OUTPUT FILE>'


fetch_urls
----------

Links in tweets are often link-shortened.  *fetch_urls* iterates through all
tweets (TwitterItems), extracts each URL found in a tweet and creates a
TwitterUserItemUrl for it, and expands the URL if possible.  The final URL
is stored as part of the TwitterUserItemUrl object.

*fetch_urls* can be run with the following options:

* --start-date -- The earliest date of tweets to fetch URLs for

* --end-date -- The latest date of tweets to fetch URLs for

* --twitter-user -- The specific twitter username to fetch URLs for

* --limit -- maximum number of URLs to fetch

* --refetch -- include tweets for which URLs were already fetched; refetch
  URLs for these tweets.

To run:

.. code-block:: none

    ./manage.py fetch_urls 


export_csv
----------

Tweets stored in SFM associated with a TwitterUser or a TwitterUserSet can be
exported in CSV (comma-separated value) format using the *export_csv*
management command.  The user interface also offers CSV exports via a link on
each TwitterUser's page (currently there is no page in the UI for a set).

The format and meaning of each column in the CSV export is explained in the
:doc:`Data Dictionary </data_dictionary>`.

*export_csv* can be run with the following options.  Either twitter-user or set-name must be specified.

--start-date -- exports only tweets starting from the specified date (YYYY-MM-DD)

--end-date -- exports only tweets through the specified date (YYYY-MM-DD)

--twitter-user -- exports tweets for the specified TwitterUser (by name)

--set-name -- exports tweets for the specified TwitterUserSet

To export tweets for Twitter user "sfmtwitteruser":

.. code-block:: none

       ./manage.py export_csv --twitter-user sfmtwitteruser

To export tweets for TwitterUserSet "myset":

.. code-block:: none

       ./manage.py export_csv --set-name myset


createconf
----------

The *createconf* command is used to create supervisord configuration files
for each active TwitterFilter.  This command should only need to be run if
TwitterFilters were created in SFM prior to version m4_002, as part of
upgrading to SFM version m4_002 or later.

*createconf* can be run with the --twitter-filter option, to create
a supervisord configuration file only for the specified TwitterFilter
(specified by numeric id).

To create configuration files for all active TwitterFilters:

.. code-block:: none
    
     ./manage.py createconf

To create configuration files for TwitterFilter 5:

.. code-block:: none
    
     ./manage.py createconf --twitter-filter 5
