Documentation
-------------

A growing set of documentation is available under the docs/ directory,
available also online:

  http://social-feed-manager.readthedocs.org/

We encourage you to read the Introduction before implementing this app.
Maintaining growing feeds of social media data takes some planning
and system adminstration experience.  The Introduction should help you
prepare for this.


Development
-----------

To work on sfm, clone/fork it in github.  If you send pull requests from
a fork, please make them as atomic as you can.

We are actively working on this, making changes in response to university
researcher requests.  If the features it supports seem fickle and spotty
it's because we're still just getting started and still figuring out
what we need it to do.  Please get in touch and tell us what you think.
